\begin{rSection}{Research Interest}
My research focuses on integrating artificial intelligence with Earth sciences to address critical environmental challenges, particularly in Arctic regions. I am experienced in developing deep learning approaches for processing remote sensing data, with emphasis on computer vision techniques for mapping permafrost degradation, wildfire impacts, and water body dynamics. My work bridges traditional geoscience with cutting-edge deep learning methods, particularly in semantic segmentation and object detection for satellite imagery analysis. Current projects include mapping retrogressive thaw slumps using neural networks to model carbon emissions from Eddy covairance tower measurements, contributing to our understanding of climate change impacts.

\begin{indentpar} {0.5cm} RTS Mapping Project Lead
\end{indentpar}
\begin{indentpar} {1cm} 
The long-term goal of this project is to produce a pan-Arctic RTS map for understanding the importance of abrupt thaw on Arctic landscapes and carbon feedback. By using state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, combined with high-resolution satellite remote sensing imagery, we aim to train and deploy a deep learning model that can detect and segment RTS features across different regions in the Arctic. This project is also associated with several Arctic-related research projects such as the Permafrost Pathways, the RTSinTrain project, the Permafrost Discovery Gateway project and the Google.org Arctic project.
